# wdi16-project-2-wander-portal
An interface to enable users to manage the Wander marketplace.

##What is the *Wander*?
Wander is a contemporary marketplace for emerging fashion and homewares brands in the UK. Unlike most marketplaces, Wander is highly curated with each 'Seller' being hand-picked based on their range, quality and overall brand aesthetic. We do this to ensure that both the young brand's themselves benefit from good company, and our customers benefit from a good shopping experience.

##What's the *problem*?
At peasent, all products are managed by Wander and not the sellers. With the aim of scaling the business, we need to enable Sellers through Wander to manage their own products and personal information.


##The *Wander Portal*

The Wander Portal is the answer to the problem; enabling Sellers to not only sign up and log in, but also upload, edit, delete and view their products - and only their products (i.e. they cannot view or manage other user's products or information).

The portal focusses first and foremost on the mobile experience for the user, keeping in mind these are individuals on the move rather than established businesses with premises.
