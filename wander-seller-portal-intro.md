#WANDER SELLER PORTAL | INTRO

##What is 'Wander'?
Wander is a contemporary marketplace for emerging fashion and homewares brands in the UK. Unlike most marketplaces, Wander is highly curated with each 'Seller' being hand-picked based on their range, quality and overall brand aesthetic. We do this to ensure that both the young brand's themselves benefit from good company, and our customers benefit from a good shopping experience.

##What's the *problem*?
Wander is at MVP v2 stage whereby there is only a consumer-facing interface, i.e. shop front. The 'back end' is 100% concierge, meaning that all products are manually created by the Wander team*.

As you can imagine, this takes up time that could be better used elsewhere; with that in mind, the longer term plan is to create a product that can automatically 'pull in' data from an external website, map relevant fields, and populate within the marketplace with little to no human intervention. 

If we can succesfully create this product, we will be able to replicate the model across multiple categories, styles, audiences, etc. and subsequently make a small business, scalable, adaptable and succesful.   

*for brands using a Shopify website, we are able to import their exported product data to more speedily populate their products on Wander.
