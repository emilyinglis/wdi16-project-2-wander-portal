#WANDER SELLER PORTAL | USER STORIES


##USER STORIES (TO CREATE)

"As a Brand selling my products on the Wander marketplace (a "seller") I need to...":

- log in to my brand's dashboard where I can quickly and easily perform keys tasks (TBD, but suggestions below):

>> view my brand profile: *My Profile*

>> view all my products: *My Products* 

>> add a new product: *Add Product*


- perform tasks (such as when creating and updating) on the following values for a Product:

>> select a pre-fixed category (such as Tops, Dresses, etc.)

>> title, description, price 

>> image(s) - ideally 3

>> sizes and assign availability / size

>> 'Brand' must be auto assigned based on the brand creds I logged in with

- view all my products (*My Products*) on a single page (INDEX), showing the product's title and first image (both linkable to the product's profile (SHOW), and quick links to it's *edit* (EDIT) page and *delete* (DELETE).

- view a product profile (SHOW) featuring the title, description, image(s), and price with sizes and relative inventory in a table, as well as 'my brand', i.e. *BRAND: My Brand*. I must be able to click through to the Edit page (EDIT) and Delete (DELETE). 

- edit a product and its values on a dedicated page (EDIT). I must not be able to edit the Brand. Upon submission (UPDATE) it must render the updated product profile page (SHOW) with a *dynamic notification* confirming changes saved.
 
- delete a product instantly (DELETE) but the action must be queried first, i.e. "Are you sure?" 

####Nice To Have:

- enable *hiding* a product from the index (and later the consumer store) instead of deleting. This will add a label to a product of 'hidden'

- be able to 'Create Similar' from the product's profile (SHOW). It would render the new product page (NEW) with values pre-populated with the existing product's values. 

- if product sold out but coming back in stock show sold out label
